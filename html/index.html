         <h2>About Me</h2>
         <h4>I am currently a student at Benedictine College in Atchison Kansas studying Computer Science.
            I believe in a learn by doing approach which is why I wanted to create this portfolio.
            Below this section you should find links to corresponding projects on Github I've created and I hope to have more on the way. </h4>
            <p>I enjoy all things coding and sports. I am always ready to learn about all things programming.
            The thought of expanding my knowledge on a new language or framework is very exciting and I can't wait to see where the industry takes me.
            I am willing to learn whatever I need to in order to excel at a job and I am always looking at new ways to solve different problems.</p>
