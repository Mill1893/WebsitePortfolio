## Introduction

This will be my first project as part of the [100 Days of Code Challenge](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4)

**The Guidelines for this project will be**:
  1. I will create a website to showcase other projects I work on throughout the challenge and then update the [log](https://github.com/Mill1893/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md) in my 100 days of code repo.
  2. I want to work with a bunch of different languages and frameworks so I'm hoping to have a good 3. website that can show off everything I've learned during this challenge.
  3. I will be creating the website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
  4. I will use the Bootstrap framework as the foundation for my website.
  5. I hope to have this project completed in 10-15 days.
